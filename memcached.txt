Memcached(MySQL-Memcached-en.pdf)

key-value, key is hashed

1. memcached [-u user_name] [-m memory] [-p port] [-U UDP_port] [-l network_interface(ip)] ...
   **//-u option for root user
   **//-m for set memory, default 64MB(use command vmstat to get free memory number)
   **//-l for set listen address, default all
   **//-p for tcp port, default 18080
   //-U for udp port
   **//-s for socket, if running memcached as same server as clients, disable network interface, and set 'memcached -s /your_memcached_path/memcached'
   //-a for mask, default 0700
   **//-c for connections, specify maximum number of simultaneout connections, default 1024
   **//-t for threads, specify number of threads to use when processing incoming requests, default 4
   **//-d for daemon(run in background)
   //-r
   //-M for return error when memory exhausted, replace normal behaviour of removing old items from cache to make way for new items
   //-k 
   *//-v for verbose mode, print error while executing, for logging
   *//-vv for very verbose mode, for logging
   *//-vvv for extremely verbose mode, for logging
   //-h for help, print help message and exit
   //-i for print libevent licence
   //-I for specify maximum size permitted for storing an object within memcached instance, k for kilobytes, m for megabytes, eg. memcached -I 32m
   //-b
   //-P for pidfile, save prcess id of memcached instance to file
   //-f 
   //-n bytes, 
   //-L
   //-c
   //-D
   //-R
   //-B
2. memcached is only caching.
   memcached is no security, so running only inside your network, encrypt info if is any sensitive.
   memcached does not provide fail over.
   try to use at least two memcached instances, for avoid having a single point of failure.
3. use namespace, for store user data, prefix id with user: or user-, for two different tables may have same ids.
4. data expiry
   1> old item(least recently used, LRU) is remove when new item add & not enough space to store
   2> set item expire tiem or delete item
5. which server to get data
   @memcservers = ['a.memc','b.memc','c.memc'];
   $value = hash($key); 
   $chosen = $value % length(@memcservers)[here is 3];
   
   // the hashing(hash($key)) is client-side, not server-side, disadvantage: add new memcached instance/remove instance/change instances order, lead to wrong info
6. memcached memory allocate only when you start saving item into memcached
7. logging
   parameter: -v/-vv/-vvv, the latter parameter is, the more detail log info is
